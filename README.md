FiniteStateMachine
==================

A simple Finite State Machine using Python

We want to recognize the meaning of small sentences with limited vocabulary and syntax:
These sentences should start with "ThisProgram is" followed by:
<li>
an adjective or
the word "not" followed by an adjective.
</li>

Examples:
"ThisProgram is great" → positive meaning
"ThisProgram is stupid" → negative meaning
"ThisProgram is not ugly" → positive meaning
