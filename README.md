FiniteStateMachine
==================

A simple <b>Finite State Machine</b> using Python

We want to recognize the meaning of small sentences with limited vocabulary and syntax:
These sentences should start with <b>"ThisProgram is"</b> followed by:

1. an adjective or
2. the word "not" followed by an adjective.


<b>Examples:</b><br>
"ThisProgram is great" → positive meaning. <br>
"ThisProgram is stupid" → negative meaning. <br>
"ThisProgram is not ugly" → positive meaning. <br>
